Prerequisites:

- Download docker locally (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- Run the 'docker-compose up -d' command in the project root where the docker-compose.yml file is located in order to start the MySQL database. (Note that docker should be running in the background in order for the command to execute and compile)
- After the docker container is started locally, you can start the spring boot application
- After each pull from git, it's not mandatory, but it's good to run docker-compose up -d --build to rebuild the image after the changes are pulled from git
